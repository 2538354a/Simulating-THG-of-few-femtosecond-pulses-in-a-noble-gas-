LEFT TO DO 
============================

- wait for feedback on report and implement it 


2d heat maps: time vs spectrum 

spectral and temporal phase of IR and UV -> fit polynomial for GVD values?
	


DNA damage -> dimerisation 

page 2: TL mean no terms higher than phi1, not phi0 DONE

page 4: "various fibre-based techniques" -> hollow-core fibre filled with helium ; beam waist at the focus -> don't say focus  DONE

page 10: CEP phase -> CEP ; fluid flow -> free molecular flow ;  various effects -> collisions with other gas molecules less likely than with walls DONE 

in general: put \, between value and unit
