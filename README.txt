DESY Summer Programme 2023
============================

GOAL:     simulate THG of a few-femtosecond IR laser beam in a 
----      noble gas; 
	  carry out parameter scans to find optimal input beam 
          conditions for desired UV output beam;   
		 


Stage 1: DONE [Week 1-2 ]
--------------------------
	
did background reading ; cleaned up existing code ; 
provided visualisation functions ; provided output handling 

Stage 2: IN PROGRESS [Week 2 - ?]
----------------------------------

provided option to base input pulse on measured data ; provided 
option to feed in custom gas density profile (untested!) ; 
provided option to overlay measured UV spectrum 
	
	PREPARE PRESENTATION FOR JOSINA


Stage 3: TO DO
-----------------------------

	- make simulation more realistic: 

		+ set up non-Gaussian spatial profile 

		+ input measured CEO phase value ?

	        + produce gas density simulations [first test existing COMSOL simulations]

		-> take more data ? (ask Josina if can join)	

	- vary pressure, beam intensity [when changing beam energy, also change beam shape (file)??], etc. to study effect on THG efficiency [Luna parameter scans...] (Ar & Ne)
		-> try to reproduce measured pressure scans (saturation, pulse shape change, second spectral peak)
			-->> conversion efficiency and pulse energy!
