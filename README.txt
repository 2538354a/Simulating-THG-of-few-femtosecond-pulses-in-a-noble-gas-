DESY Summer Programme 2023
============================

GOAL:     simulate THG of a few-femtosecond IR laser beam in a 
----      noble gas; 
	  carry out parameter scans to find optimal input beam 
          conditions for desired UV output beam;   
		 


Stage 1: DONE [Week 1-2]
--------------------------
	
did background reading ; cleaned up existing code ; 
provided visualisation functions ; provided output handling 

Stage 2: IN PROGRESS [Week 2]
----------------------------------

provided option to base input pulse on measured data ; provided 
option to feed in custom gas density profile (untested!) ; 
provided option to overlay measured UV spectrum 
	

Stage 3: TO DO
-----------------------------

wait for COMSOL: 

Investigate CEO phase
Turn off ionisation
Investigate different beam energies, pressures and gases [does saturation ever set in?]
		Rewrite code for scans [pdf -> png; loop structure]
		read in spectral input data as well ?!
 

Read papers! -> find nonlinear effects ?!

	maybe do look into Nonlinear effects on Luna again? (Kerr_field, Kerr_env, Kerr_field_nothg, Kerr_env_thg)!

Email Luna team ?!
